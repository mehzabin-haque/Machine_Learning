# Machine Learning Algorithms 

## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The included algorithms cover a range of tasks, such as classification, clustering, association rule mining, and skin detection. The code is tested on reliable datasets like breast_cancer and iris, providing crucial insights and accuracy evaluation.

## Algorithms Included
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks based on data similarity.
2. K-Means: An unsupervised clustering algorithm for partitioning data into K clusters based on similarity.
3. Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
4. Decision Tree: A predictive model used for classification and regression tasks based on tree-like structures.
5. Apriori: A widely-used association rule mining algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in transaction databases.
6. Conflict Serializable: A concurrency control technique for detecting conflicts in concurrent database transactions.
7. Naive Bayes: A probabilistic algorithm used for classification based on Bayes' theorem.
8. Skin Detection: A custom implementation of a machine learning model for detecting human skin color regions.

## Dataset Information and Testing
The code is trained and tested on reliable datasets like breast_cancer and iris. Users can evaluate the algorithms' performance and accuracy using these datasets. The repository provides clear instructions on running the code and interpreting the results.

## Usage
Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python script. Users can run the scripts individually or use Jupyter notebooks to explore the code, understand the implementation, and experiment with the datasets.

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are encouraged. If you would like to add more machine learning algorithms, improve existing implementations, or include additional datasets for testing, feel free to submit a pull request.
